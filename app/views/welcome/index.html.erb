      <br>
        <p class='infoparagraph'>I am a motivated, determined individual with a creative and practical mindset seeking</br> a job in web development. My background in design, enthusiasm for both front and </br>backend development along with my strong attention to detail makes me a good candidate </br>for a position as a web developer.

          <p class='infoparagraph'>Being new at programming Lighthouse opened my eyes to the world of full stack web design.<br>Coding was not the only thing expected with this boot camp. Self­teaching and extremely organised <br>time management were necessary to flourish in this environment.

          <p class='infoparagraph'>With Visual Arts we were forced to look at the bigger picture. I feel as though going through a program <br>like this helps someone become a great problem solver. Alot of the classes that I took were done<br> on the computer so my design oriented skills on a computer are highly refined. I consider myself a quick<br> learner that is doesn’t say no to a challenge.
